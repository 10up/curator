Select specific posts from across multiple post types to combine together and control the ordering.

== Description ==

If you've ever needed to create a query that pulls in multiple post types, posts and post formats but still allow for the control of the order of those items, you'll find WordPress falls a bit short.

Curator let's you specify which post types should be curated and then provides an interface for ordering those.

== Installation ==
